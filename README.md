# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-Titanic-Dataset

This repository contains my mini project for the Digital Skill Fair 38.0 – Data Science & Data Analyst program by dibimbing.id. The project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset using Python.

## 📄 About the Project

The Titanic dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in data science. It provides demographic and survival information of passengers aboard the Titanic. In this project, I conducted EDA to understand the data, clean it, and uncover meaningful patterns that could help explain passenger survival rates.

The dataset used contains **500 rows and 4 columns**:
- `survived`: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `name`: Passenger name
- `age`: Age of the passenger
- `sex`: Gender of the passenger

## 🔍 Goals of the Analysis

- Perform basic exploration of the dataset (head, tail, data types, etc.)
- Handle missing values and duplicates
- Generate descriptive statistics and visualize data distributions
- Investigate correlation between variables (e.g., age and survival)

## 🧪 Tools and Libraries

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scipy

## 📊 Key EDA Insights

- Cleaned data by removing duplicates and handling missing values in the `age` column.
- Found outliers and performed basic statistics like mean, median, and distribution plots.
- Analyzed correlation between `age` and `survived` using **Point-Biserial Correlation**.
